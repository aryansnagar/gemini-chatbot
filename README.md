The frontend files are located in the `templates` and `static` folders:

- `templates/index.html`  Contains the main HTML structure, including the message list and input field.
- `static/css/style.css`  CSS file to style the frontend interface.
- `static/js/main.js`  JavaScript file that handles sending messages to and receiving replies from the Flask backend.  

>Make sure in `index.html` to reference CSS and JS as follows
>```
><link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}">
><script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/main.js') }}"></script>
>```

## Backend

- `main.py`  The Flask Python script that runs the backend server, exposes the `/api/chat` POST endpoint, and communicates with the Gemini API.
- `.env`  Contains your Gemini API key and any other environment variables.
